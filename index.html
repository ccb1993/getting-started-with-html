<h1>Important Concepts</h1>

<!--If I were to point out other language references in the document, I would do so in the head (i.e. CSS)-->

<b>World Wide Web: How it works</b>
<p>-Many computers communicate with eachother<br>-When someone goes to a web page, an <em>HTTP Request</em> is sent to a <em>server</em> (computer at another location hosting web files)<br>-Servers send back appropriate <em>HTML</em> documents to fulfill requests sent by user computers<br>-Computers interpret HTML documents via browsers</p>

<b>HTML</b>
<br>
<em>"Hyper Text Markup Language"</em>
<br>
<p>-HTML documents are the basis of the web and form most web content<br>-<em>text content</em> is "what you see"<br>-<em>markup</em> is "what it looks like"<br>-used to reference other documents and provide links to other pages<br>-regular text in HTML will appear as just regular text</p>

<b>Tags and Elements</b>
<p>-HTML documents consist of HTML <em>elements</em><br>-Elements consist of <em>tags</em> (opening at the beginning, closing at the end) which define the properties of text inside HTML documents</p>

<b>Examples</b>
<p>can make text <b>bold</b>
  <br>can make text <em>italicized</em>
  <br>can add links to web pages or videos: <a href="www.udacity">udacity<a/>
  <br>can add links to images: <img src="http://www.udacity.com/cs253x/hipmunk.png" alt ="there is a chipmunk like creature here that you're supposed to see (with a scarf and what appear to be googles who may or may not be pretending to fly)"></p>

<p>**Remember:<em> It's ok to forget codes, you can always look them up</em></p>
  <br>
<b>Computers are STUPID</b>
<p>They interpret instructions literally, so small mistakes can cause huge problems. They don't have deductive reasoning skills like people (not always).</p>

<b>Inline vs. Block Elements</b>
<p><em>Inline</em> elements differ from <em>block</em> elements as they just stay in line whereas block elements form a "box" around what is inside them making the content inside a package deal with regards to where it is located on a page.</p>
